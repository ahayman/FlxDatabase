/**
 *  The SQLStatement takes a bunch of information (columns, predicates, orderings, groups, etc) and will construct an SQL statment (thus the name...).  Not all the properties available on this class will work for all situations. Specifically, some properties only apply to a query while others will only apply to an update. Each property will explain when and where it can be used.
 *  
 *  @warning You cannot simply `init` (or `new`) this class. It must have a table name in order to be constructed, so one is required.
 *
 *  Generally, you construct a SQLStatement by adding columns, predicates, etc and then pass it to the SQLDatabaseManager for processing. Be careful about creating a SQLStatement, passing it to the manager for processing, and then immediately modifying it. The SQLDatabaseManager doesn't copy the statement, so you'll be modifying the original which could lead to undesirable results.  If you're going to reuse a statement, it's probably best to pass to the manager a copy of the statement instead.
 *
 *  There are quite a few auto-generated readonly properties. However, the order you access some of them is important. Normally, you won't need to access these, except perhaps, to debug a statement but when you do, this is important to know:
    - The `NSString *newStatement` property is auto-generated and *is not cached*. Each time you access it, you're creating a new statement. So if you need to access this, it's recommended you store the string in a local variable.
    - When a `statement` is generated, so also are the parameters: `NSArray *parameters`, and `parameters` *is* cached.  So if you attempt to access a statement's parameters before you access the statement, you'll either get `nil` or you'll get old parameters (if you've modified the statement).
    - Property `NSString *GUID` is auto-generated.  You *can* set your own GUID if you want, pass the statement to the database manager and it will be used (for insertion/updating).  However, this is not recommended. The GUID must be unique to that table.  If not, the statement will fail since the GUID is the primary key on the table. Instead, use the auto-generated GUID (by simply accessing the property one will be generated and cached) and pass the statement to the manager.  Just be aware that the manager will set the GUID to `nil` when it's done, but *after* the return block has been called.  This way, if you pass the statement to the manager again, a new GUID will be created.
    - NSNumber *modified & *created properties are automatically cached when an update/insertion statement is generated. You can set these beforehand by adding a column with one of the default colum names and setting it's value. However, you really shouldn't need to do this. The updated & created dates are automagically generated, which you can access after the SQLStatement has been run.
